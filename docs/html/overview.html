<h1><a class="anchor" name="overview">Overview of COMPASS</a></h1>COMPASS is a model that was based off of the older CRiSP (Columbia River Salmon Passage Model) and is being updated for more widespread use.<p>
The model estimates survival of fish of different <a class="el" href="structspecies.html" title="Species parameters.">species</a> (currently Chinook 0, Chinook 1, and Steelhead) through the dams on the Columbia river (as well as some tributaries).<p>
COMPASS runs and is tested on the following platforms:<ul>
<li>Windows XP (perhaps others, but I haven't tested them) (see <a class="el" href="windows.html">COMPASS on Windows</a>)</li><li>Linux (specifically x86-64 Red Hat Linux) (see <a class="el" href="linux.html">COMPASS on Linux</a>)</li><li>SunOS 5.7 (SPARC) (see <a class="el" href="sunos.html">COMPASS on Solaris</a>)</li></ul>
<p>
The model consists of two main pieces:<ul>
<li>The command (or batch) version which is written in C (see <a class="el" href="batch.html">Command line (batch) version</a>)</li><li>The GUI interface which is written in C++ using the Qt GUI toolkit (see <a class="el" href="gui.html">COMPASS GUI mode</a> and <a class="el" href="help.html">Integrated Help System</a>)</li></ul>
<p>
Data is read into the model and output from the model as described in the <a class="el" href="io.html">Input/output</a> section.<p>
The main logical components of a scenario in the model are listed here:<ul>
<li>Run: parameters relating to the entire execution of the model (e.g. the list of releases).</li><li>River segments: sections of the river that may be of several different types. The segments form a tree with the Columbia river mouth (river_mouth in the code) being the root of the tree.<ul>
<li>Headwaters: waters that feed the parts of the river that are actually used in the model. These define parameters like water temperatures, flows, turbidity, etc.</li><li>Reaches: stretches of the river between headwaters, dams, and the river mouth. Upstream from a dam this is called a pool or reservoir. Directly downstream of a dam this is called a tailrace.</li><li>Dams: segments corresponding to dams on the river. These define passage routes and mortalities of fish through those routes.</li><li>Powerhouses: for dams like Bonneville that have multiple powerhouses (that are mostly independent), powerhouse segments represent those other parts of the dam. Note that these segments are not really part of the river tree but are instead linked to dam segments on the river.</li></ul>
</li><li>Species: stores parameters for an entire <a class="el" href="structspecies.html" title="Species parameters.">species</a> of fish.</li><li>Stocks: stores parameters for fish that will be released at a specific place (this is to model the fact that fish coming from one area may have different characteristics than fish from another).</li><li>Releases: where fish are put into the model (this is not necessarily where the fish entered the river, just where they start being modeled).</li><li>Transport operations: at some dams, fish are collected in the bypass and then put on a barge and transported down river so as to avoid the need to pass through dams. </li></ul>
