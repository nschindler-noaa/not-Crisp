<h1><a class="anchor" name="source">Source Control</a></h1>The COMPASS development effort uses CVS to keep track of revisions in the source tree.<p>
The CVS repository is located on gandhi in the /var/lib/cvs directory. When using bash the appropriate settings might look like the following:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">export CVSROOT=:ext:USER@gandhi.cbr.washington.edu:/var/lib/cvs
export CVS_RSH=ssh
</pre></div><p>
Putting these into the ~/.bashrc file should make CVS use transparent (i.e. you don't need to always use the "-d" flag).<p>
Since COMPASS was originally based off of CRiSP and did not have a name initially, the source code is in the repository under the module (directory) "crisp" instead of something more obvious like "compass".<p>
The main development branch is "NOT_CRISP" since initially it was thought that CRiSP development would continue in parallel. Releases of COMPASS are tagged with names such as "COMPASS_0_27" for COMPASS version 0.27 (see <a class="el" href="releasing.html">Making a New Release</a>). Here is an example of checking out the latest COMPASS source code: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">cvs co -r NOT_CRISP crisp
</pre></div><p>
Remember to update the "Changelog" file with any changes that have been made. The format that I have been using looks like the following: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">5/17: documentation.h
Wrote documentation <span class="keywordflow">for</span> source control
Fixed a few little bugs
</pre></div><p>
Finally, always remember to add files to CVS that are considered part of the source code (using "cvs add"). Note that when adding files to CVS, also make sure that they are added to the appropriate build files (see <a class="el" href="build.html#build_add_files">Adding Files</a>).<p>
Help on CVS commands can be seen with: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">cvs --help-commands
</pre></div><h2><a class="anchor" name="branch">
Using branches for development</a></h2>
It is very useful to perform large changes on a branch of development because it is possible that you will need to apply bug fixes to the last <a class="el" href="structrelease.html" title="Release parameters.">release</a> (and make a new <a class="el" href="structrelease.html" title="Release parameters.">release</a>) before the major changes are completed. CVS supports the notion of branches, but it can easily be misused and so the following conventions are necessary.<p>
By convention, when a branch is made it is given a name like "NOT_CRISP_NEW_FEATURE" where the "NEW_FEATURE" part is the name of the feature (e.g. "PBN_HYPOTHESES" for post-Bonneville hypothesis support). Note that the -b flag is for making a branch rather than just a normal tag. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">cvs tag -b NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES     # Create the branch
cvs up -r NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES      # Switch to <span class="keyword">this</span> branch

<span class="preprocessor"># To switch back to the main branch:</span>
<span class="preprocessor">cvs up -dPr NOT_CRISP</span>
</pre></div><p>
Once the development on a branch is completed, it is necessary to tag everything before merging the changes back to the main branch. The convention that I use is something like "NOT_CRISP_BRANCH_MERGE" since this is easy to remember. Once the changes have been merged, you must tag the main branch to mark that changes have been merged (I use a tag with the past tense "merged" on the end as in "NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGED"). <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">cvs tag NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGE  # Mark as ready to merge
cvs up -dPr NOT_CRISP   # Switch to <a class="code" href="compassb_8c.html#0ddf1224851353fc92bfbff6f499fa97" title="This is the main entry point for batch mode.">main</a> development branch
cvs up -j NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGE        # Merge in the changes
cvs ci -m'Merged in post-Bonneville branch'     # Commit the changes
cvs tag NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGED         # Mark that changes were merged
</pre></div><p>
The reason for using all these tags is that if the branch needs to be removed or development continues on the branch these tags provide the ability to do so. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">cvs tag NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGE2 # Mark as ready to merge again
cvs up -dPr NOT_CRISP   # Switch to <a class="code" href="compassb_8c.html#0ddf1224851353fc92bfbff6f499fa97" title="This is the main entry point for batch mode.">main</a> development branch
cvs up -j NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGE2 -j NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGE     # Merge in the <span class="keyword">new</span> changes
cvs ci -m'Merged in post-Bonneville branch'     # Commit the <span class="keyword">new</span> changes
cvs tag NOT_CRISP_PBN_HYPOTHESES_MERGED2                # Mark that <span class="keyword">new</span> changes were merged
