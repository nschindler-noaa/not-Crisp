<h1><a class="anchor" name="linux">COMPASS on Linux</a></h1>A lot of development is done on Linux simply because the main development machine runs Linux natively and some of the command line tools are a little easier to use than anything I have found under Windows.<p>
When compiling for Linux, it is very important to look at the libraries that are linked with (using the "ldd" command) so that the executables are portable to other Linux users. Linux is very unlike Windows because on Windows executables just seem to work on any computer.<p>
Read more about compiling in <a class="el" href="build.html#build_unix">UNIX Build Process</a>.<h2><a class="anchor" name="linux_elmer">
Running/Maintaining Linux on elmer</a></h2>
The Linux machine elmer.cbr.washington.edu was added while I worked here and some documentation on how it all works is probably in order. The machine runs Red Hat Linux and is mostly straightforward to use. Logging in and out and shutting down/bringing up the machine can all be done graphically. If the system locks up, ctrl-alt-del should cause it to restart unless it is completely locked up at which <a class="el" href="structpoint.html" title="Point structure that represents a geographic point using latitude and longitude.">point</a> the power button should do the trick.<p>
Red Hat sells an update service which I believe the free trial (that came with the machine) is going to <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> out soon. It is my understanding that essential updates (to fix security problems) are available for free and it is only software feature upgrades that would not be available if a paid subscription is not set up. I personally don't see a reason to set up the paid subscription (and I don't know how to set it up), but you might want to talk to the other people running Linux at NOAA and see what they're doing.<p>
The up2date utility checks for updates, but there is one very important thing to keep in mind: 6 of the updates are marked as ignored (they update very low-level software such as the kernel). The first time I attempt to do these updates, there was a problem and the system was rendered unusable and I had to use Dell's system restore which consequently lost all of the data on the computer.<p>
DO NOT UPGRADE IGNORED PACKAGES OR THE KERNEL WHEN DOING UPDATES.<p>
For information on running Windows in VMware on this machine, see <a class="el" href="windows.html#windows_vmware">Using Windows from VMware</a>.<p>
Other problems include the following:<ul>
<li>I was unable to get dual-monitor suport to work.</li><li>Sometimes when the computer is left idle and it goes into power-saving mode, it doesn't appear possible to wake the system up.</li><li>Adding extra software from the CDs that came with the system does not appear to work.<ul>
<li>The only thing that has worked for me is to use RPMs downloaded from the Internet or install software from source code.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
On the whole I would say that in the future it would make more sense to purchase Windows machines and then <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> Linux inside VMware (on Windows) instead of this setup. Windows seems to support the hardware better, Red Hat Linux is disappointing, and it's easy to <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> Linux in VMware since Linux distributions are free anyway. <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Feb 4 10:53:44 2008 for COMPASS Source Code by&nbsp;
