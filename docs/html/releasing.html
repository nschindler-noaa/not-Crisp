<h1><a class="anchor" name="releasing">Making a New Release</a></h1>Releasing a new version of COMPASS takes some manual work, but it is pretty straight forward.<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Once a version is tested and ready to be released, make sure all the changes (including any new files) have been committed to CVS on the main development branch.</li><li>Increment the minor (or perhaps major if COMPASS is finally at version 1.0) version number and string in <a class="el" href="version_8h.html" title="The version of COMPASS (see releasing).">version.h</a>.</li><li>Tag the <a class="el" href="structrelease.html" title="Release parameters.">release</a> in CVS using a command like "cvs tag COMPASS_0_33".</li><li>On Linux, update the checked out version (if necessary) and <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> "make clean" and then "make compassb" (for the batch version)</li><li>On gandhi, update the checked out version (if necessary) and <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> "make clean" and then "make compassb" (for the batch version)</li><li>On Windows, after updating (if necessary), <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> Build -&gt; Batch Build -&gt; Rebuild All (check that all boxes are checked)</li><li>Once compilation is done on Windows, <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> Inno Setup and open the "setup.iss" file (check to make sure the directories in this file are correct!) and click compile</li><li>Finally take the compiled installer and send it out (also send out any other versions or notifications of new versions for Linux and on gandhi)</li><li>Or upload the file on gandhi to /var/httpd/www/htdocs/downloads/compass/ and email the link which will be at "http://www.cbr.washington.edu/downloads/compass/&lt;name of file&gt;"</li></ol>
<p>
Note that when sending out a new version, UW email filters often strip attachments ending in ".exe" so I have been changing it to ".dat" and instructing the recipients to save it as ".exe" themselves. This appears to work, but I'm not sure this extra step is still necessary. <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Feb 4 10:53:44 2008 for COMPASS Source Code by&nbsp;
