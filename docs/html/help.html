<h1><a class="anchor" name="help">Integrated Help System</a></h1>The COMPASS GUI contains a great deal of documentation from the old CRiSP interface (although it is currently disabled, though this may change in the near future).<p>
The help files are stored in the "help/" directory and are currently only considered to be the ".html", ".jpg", and ".toc" files in that folder. Note that help files should be placed in CVS for version control (but not anything in "help/output/").<p>
The help files are actually compiled into the main executable using static data in C (see <a class="el" href="help.html#build_help">Building the Help System</a>). The help files are then read in using the qHelpMimeSourceFactory class in qHelpWindow.cpp (which in turn uses a Qt text area widget that acts as a browser). The table of contents is stored in an XML file called "help/crisp.toc" whose format should be self-explanatory.<p>
The details of all of this are probably not terribly important but things of note are that the "search" feature in the GUI help system actually only searches the table of contents and not keywords or actual contents. Better searching may be helpful in the future but since the help system is currently disabled anyway, this is not a high-priority task.<h2><a class="anchor" name="build_help">
Building the Help System</a></h2>
Since the help system is compiled directly into an executable, there needed to be a way to bridge the gap from a directory of help files to data that is stored inside the executable.<p>
To this end, the bin2c program (in the "bin2c_src" directory) was written. This program reads in a file and outputs a C source file (with a given variable name) and optionally a C header file.<p>
The help_index.sh script is a GNU BASH (Bourne shell) script that runs bin2c and creates the necessary header files for using the static data. Note that this means that the bin2c program must be compiled before help_index.sh can be <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> (this is really only an issue on the Windows platform since the Makefiles handle this on UNIX). The help_index.sh script can be <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> from Windows using the Cygwin UNIX emultation environment with BASH installed.<p>
All output is written to the "help/output/" directory so that folder can be safely deleted to clean out stale data.<p>
The main header file that is written out is called "help/output/help_include.h". Note that this file does not actually include all the data files (they are compiled separately) because the C compiler (specifically its parser) cannot handle the extremely large arrays that are created by the bin2c program.<p>
The consequence of this is that all the C files that fill in the data files must be compiled separately (this is handled in the Makefiles on UNIX platforms). On Windows, this means that the help files must be added to the "Source Files\help_compiled" folder in order to be compiled and then linked in. <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Feb 4 10:53:44 2008 for COMPASS Source Code by&nbsp;
