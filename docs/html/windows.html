<h1><a class="anchor" name="windows">COMPASS on Windows</a></h1>The COMPASS GUI is mainly used on Windows whereas the other platforms are mainly for testing the GUI (but no one actually uses the GUI on them).<p>
The main issues when working with Windows seem to revolve around the fact that it's not based on UNIX so common UNIX assumptions are not necessarily valid.<p>
For example, standard input and output are not automatically opened in <a class="el" href="structrelease.html" title="Release parameters.">release</a> mode on Windows. For Windows debug mode, a terminal is automatically opened which is not useful except to debug using printf() statements.<p>
Note that the Qt library is compiled in statically so the COMPASS GUI is not dependent on the Qt DLL being present on the machine. Also note that the version of Qt that is used is not free on Windows, so don't lose the copy of Qt that CBR has! Also read <a class="el" href="build.html#build_windows">Windows Build Process</a>.<p>
One final <a class="el" href="structpoint.html" title="Point structure that represents a geographic point using latitude and longitude.">point</a> is that the erf() and erfc() functions (defined in <a class="el" href="travel__table_8c.html" title="implementation of a travel table using the vectable module.">travel_table.c</a> for Windows) are not implemented by default on Windows, but they are implemented by default on both Linux and Solaris (Linux and Solaris actually use the same implementation), so if there are slight calculation differences between Windows and the UNIX versions, this may be the likely culprit.<h2><a class="anchor" name="windows_vmware">
Using Windows from VMware</a></h2>
Most COMPASS development is done on a Linux machine (elmer.cbr.washington.edu) that runs Windows simultaneously using VMware's machine virtualization software.<p>
The actual system image (which resides in the Linux filesystem as regular files) was created with a trial version of VMware Workstation for Linux. The system can be started and <a class="el" href="structrun.html" title="Entire run parameters.">run</a> completely using the free VMware Player software, so I don't consider it necessary to purchase VMware Workstation (it was $150 last time I checked) unless additional systems are created (although it's important to keep in mind Microsoft's Windows licensing restrictions in this case--each virtual machine has to be licensed like a normal machine).<p>
The Windows system that runs inside VMware is pretty much just like a normal system--it can be accessed through the network (as pooh.cbr.washington.edu) and it's possible to use the normal SSH toolkit to send and receive files (in order to pass data between Windows and Linux if necessary). The Windows system also has its own licensed copies of Windows XP Professional and Microsoft Office (I believe Christine has all the information on these).<p>
All the files are currently in my home directory on elmer.cbr.washington.edu in "~jkrinke/vmware/Windows XP Professional Development/" and the file that is opened with VMware player is "Windows XP Professional Development.vmx". <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Mon Feb 4 10:53:44 2008 for COMPASS Source Code by&nbsp;
