<h4>Run Monte Carlo Interactively</h4>
<p>
The steps to run COMPASS in Monte Carlo Mode are as follows:
</p><ol>

<li>Select <strong>Run<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="75.html"><strong>Monte Carlo</strong></a> to open Monte Carlo Tool.

<li>Edit alternatives, if necessary, using the three panels of the Monte Carlo window described in <a href="380.html">Set Monte Carlo Parameters</a>.

<li><a href="381.html">Set Monte Carlo Output and Runtime Settings</a>.

<li>Select each desired alternative in the <strong>Alternatives to run</strong> list; you can run multiple alternatives at the same time.

<li>Select if supplemental data is required. The <strong>Write supplemental data</strong> check box is located in the <strong>Run control</strong> panel. This will produce a <code>summary.alt#</code> file with all the data specified by <a href="63.html">Output Settings</a> in the yearly input data files for each alternative in the run. In addition, you can choose to have this information also recorded in the <a href="84.html">Message Log</a> by turning on Messages (this produces a considerable amount of information in the log window).

<li>Click <strong>Run</strong>. The <strong>Run control</strong> panel contains three progress bars: Alt Games, Alt Years, and Alternatives.

<li>View <a href="384.html">Monte Carlo Results</a>.
</ol>
<p>
Monte Carlo runs are time-consuming. A 500-game run may take several hours, or more, to run. It is recommended to select several alternatives to run, start the run, and let it run overnight. You can shrink COMPASS into an icon while it is running. <strong>Do not quit while the model is running</strong>.
