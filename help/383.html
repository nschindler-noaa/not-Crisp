<h4>Run Monte Carlo in Batch Mode</h4>
<p>
<a href="75.html">Monte Carlo</a> alternatives can be run in batch mode. The steps to running COMPASS in batch mode are as follows:
</p><ol>

<li>Use the graphical user interface to <a href="378.html">Create New Alternatives</a> and <a href="380.html">Set Monte Carlo Parameters</a>, making sure to specify the flow archive, the yearly input data files, and the desired output data. All alternatives must be saved on disk.

<li>Create or modify a file named <code>.crisp1-alts</code>. The file must exist in the same directory where your COMPASS program and all the alternatives reside. The model will run all the alternatives listed in the <code>.crisp1-alts</code> file before concluding. This file can be created using any text editing tool. It simply contains a list of the names of the alternatives to be run, one on each line. For example,
<pre>	altern1
altern2
...</pre>

<li>Once you create your alternatives and a <code>.crisp1-alts</code> file in place, COMPASS can be run in batch mode from a shell which would otherwise not be able to run the model using the graphical user interface. Batch mode is executed from the command prompt. Please see the <a href="317.html">Running in Batch Mode</a> section for special instructions on batch mode operations. You can start batch Monte Carlo mode runs from the command prompt by typing any of the following example commands.
<br> - Unix using <code>crisp1</code>
<br><code>crisp1 -b -u</code>
<br> - Unix using the batch mode only program, <code>crisp1bat</code>
<br><code>crisp1bat -c batch.cnf</code>
<br> - Windows 95/NT using <code>crisp1</code> (redirects both output streams to the same file)
<br><code>crisp1 -bm 1&gt;output.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</code>
<br> - Windows 95/NT using <code>crisp1b</code> (redirects output streams to shell)
<br><code>crisp1b -r columbia.desc -u</code>

<li>View <a href="384.html">Monte Carlo Results</a>.
</ol>
<p>
See the <a href="316.html">Starting from the Command Prompt</a> section for further information on command line options for COMPASS. 
</p><p>
Monte Carlo runs are time-consuming. A 500-game run may take several hours, or more, to run. It is recommended that you select several alternatives to run, start the run, and let it run overnight. <strong>Windows 95/NT users, do not quit while the model is running</strong>.
