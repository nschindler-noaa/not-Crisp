<h3>Run Scenario: Scenario Mode</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="372.html"><strong>Run</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Run Scenario</strong> executes a Scenario Mode run using the data currently stored in the model. The data is a combination of parameter data read into the model and any changes in settings you have applied. In addition, the <strong>Run Scenario</strong> command is represented by <img src="run1.jpg"> in the <strong>Toolbar</strong>. Scenario Mode is used for determining migration and survival for a single year at a time. The model can be run in the Scenario Mode using its default settings as determined by <code>base.dat</code>. Normally, the default settings are replaced by reading user-specified parameter data into the model, selecting release sites, and running COMPASS. The results can be viewed in <a href="34.html">Passage Histograms</a>, and statistical results can be viewed in the <a href="84.html">Message Log</a> or in the <code>summary.dat</code> file which contains results from the most recent Scenario Mode run.
