<li><strong>hydraulic capacity</strong>: The maximum flow a dam can pass through its turbines.

<li><strong>hydrostatic pressure</strong>: The pressure exerted or transmitted by water at rest.

<li><strong>HYSSR</strong>: HYdro System Seasonal Regulation model, simulates power generating and flood control characteristics of the Columbia/Snake Basin, producing predicted flows at federal projects along the river. This model is administered by the Army Corps of Engineers.

<li><strong>input</strong>: Refers to data in a file that is read by COMPASS to set certain values when the model is run. It also refers to any addition or change in the number or value of something, such as "input of fish to a reservoir."

<li><strong>kcfs</strong>: Thousand cubic feet per second.

<li><strong>kfs</strong>: Thousand feet per second.

<li><strong>latlon</strong>: The latitude and longitude coordinate for a point in the river system, <br>e.g. latlon 46 09 00 N 123 16 00 W marks 46 degrees 9 minutes north latitude, 123 degrees 16 minutes west longitude.

<li><strong>model</strong>: Refers to either COMPASS or some other mathematical representation of a process.

<li><strong>Monte Carlo</strong>: A technique for producing estimates of "true" outcomes of stochastic processes by simply running many iterations of the model process and averaging the outcomes together. Results are given as statistics, e.g. mean and standard deviation of variable X.

<li><strong>nitrogen supersaturation</strong>: This term is no longer used. See <strong>total dissolved gas supersaturation</strong>.

<li><strong>output</strong>: Refers to a result that is reported by COMPASS or some other outcome or product such as "flow output from an upstream segment."

<li><strong>PIT tag</strong>: Passive Interrogative Transponder tag; a tag that is typically inserted into the peritoneal cavity and allows identification of individual fish when they pass a detection facility.

<li><strong>predator</strong>: Northern pikeminnow (<em>Ptychocheilus oregonensis</em>).

<li><strong>primary powerhouse</strong>: At dams with more than one powerhouse (e.g. Bonneville), the powerhouse that is operated preferentially.

<li><strong>reach</strong>: A continuous stretch or expanse of the river.

<li><strong>regulated</strong>: Condition whereby stream flow is constrained by a dam.

<li><strong>release group</strong>: A group of fish either wild or released from a hatchery identified by a unique set of parameters.

<li><strong>reservoir</strong>: An artificial lake where water is collected and kept in quantity for use.

<li><strong>roller</strong>: Turbulent, aerated water in the stilling basin below the spillway.

<li><strong>runoff</strong>: Portion of rain or snowmelt that runs across the land surface and flows through the surface soil, ultimately reaching the stream or river.

<li><strong>salmonid</strong>: A member of the family Salmonidae, which includes salmon, trout and whitefish.

<li><strong>SAM</strong>: System Analysis Model which produces predicted flows at projects on the Columbia and Snake Rivers based on power and flood control requirements. This model is administered by the BPA.

<li><strong>scenario</strong>: A single set of parameter values run through the model for a single year simulation.

<li><strong>secondary powerhouse</strong>: At dams with more than one powerhouse, the powerhouse that operates second.

<li><strong>sluiceways</strong>: Routes for water around a dam. Also considered a bypass for fish.

<li><strong>smolt</strong>: A juvenile salmonid migrating to the ocean and undergoing physiological changes (called smoltification) to adapt from a freshwater to a saltwater environment.

<li><strong>smoltification</strong>: See <strong>smolt</strong>.

<li><strong>spill</strong>: Water released through a dam's spillway rather than through its turbines.

<li><strong>spill allocation</strong>: Indicates the amount of river flow allotted to spill.

<li><strong>spillway</strong>: The channel or passageway around or over a dam through which excess water is released without going through the turbines. It is a safety valve for a dam and must be capable of discharging major floods without damaging the dam while maintaining the reservoir level below some predetermined maximum level.

<li><strong>stilling basin</strong>: Short area beyond a dam spillway where water is controlled prior to release.

<li><strong>stochastic</strong>: Containing some randomness, e.g. "stochastic process."

<li><strong>stock</strong>: A population of fish that spawn in a particular stream during a particular season. Such fish generally do not breed with fish spawning in a different stream or at a different time.

<li><strong>substock</strong>: A portion of a stock.

<li><strong>subyearling</strong>: A juvenile anadromous fish that is less than one year old. This term is used primarily to refer to juvenile salmon such as fall chinook, which become smolts and migrate from freshwater production areas to the ocean at an age of less than one year. Also referred to as chinook 0. Fall chinook refers to the season when adults migrate upstream.

<li><strong>tailrace</strong>: An area of rapidly-moving water immediately downstream from a dam, typically about a kilometer in length.

<li><strong>thalweg volume</strong>: A portion of the total calculated volume of the river, essentially the middle of the river.

<li><strong>total dissolved gas (tdg) supersaturation</strong>: When water plunges over the spillway of a dam into the stilling basin, additional air is forced into the water. This results in an amount of total dissolved gas in the water which is greater than the saturation amount (greater than the maximum amount which can remain dissolved for a long period). Over time, the excess dissolved gas will return to the atmosphere. Until then, the water is referred to as "supersaturated." TDG is measured in terms of the percentage of gas in excess of the saturation amount.

<li><strong>transportation</strong>: Collecting migrating smolt at collection facilities and transporting them in trucks or barges around dams.

<li><strong>transportation velocity</strong>: Speed at which fish are moved downstream via barge or truck.

<li><strong>turbine</strong>: A mechanism in a dam that rotates with the force of water and produces electricity.

<li><strong>unregulated</strong>: Condition whereby streams flow into another stream with no intervening dam.

<li><strong>upstream propagation</strong>: Back-calculation of flows at upstream locations based on flows at downstream locations.

<li><strong>water budget</strong>: A volume of storage water in acre-feet that is reserved to augment spring and summer flows through the hydrosystem.

<li><strong>yearling</strong>: Juvenile anadromous fish that are one year old or older. This term is used primarily to refer to juvenile salmon such as coho or spring chinook or steelhead that become smolts and migrate from freshwater production areas to the ocean at an age of one or more years. Also referred to as chinook 1. Spring chinook refers to the season when adults migrate upstream.
