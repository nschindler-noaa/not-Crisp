<h3>Monte Analysis: Monte Analysis Tool</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="390.html"><strong>Analysis</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Monte Analysis</strong> opens the <strong>Monte Analysis Tool</strong> and its companion window the <a href="63.html">Analysis Tool</a> graph window. Using these windows, you can visually examine the results of a Monte Carlo run. You can plot either the survival or travel time results as a straight frequency histogram or as a cumulative probability histogram.

<b>Monte Analysis Tool features</b>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Alternative</strong>: Select an Alternative from the list of possible alternatives in the COMPASS home directory (the directory from which COMPASS was started).

<li><strong>Year</strong>: Select Year for the alternative.

<li><strong>Release</strong>: Select Release for the alternative.

<li><strong>Passage Point</strong>: Select Passage Point for the alternative.

<li><strong>Data Type</strong>: Select Survival or Travel Time.

<li><strong>Graph Type</strong>: Select Frequency or Cumulative.

<li><strong>Histogram Statistics</strong>
<br> - Mean, Std Dev, Coeff Var, Skew, Kurtosis: Statistics for survival or travel time depending on the <strong>Data Type</strong> selection.
<br> - # of Games: Number of games completed in the selected alternative.

<li><strong>Day of Passage</strong>
<br> - Mean, Median, Mode, Std Dev: Passage statistics for the release at the passage point.
<br> - First: First day of passage for the release at the passage point.
<br> - Last: Last day of passage for the release at the passage point.

<li><strong>Route Passage Fractions</strong>
<br> - Bypass: Percent of the release that survived that passed the dam through the bypass.
<br> - Turbine: Percent of the release that survived that passed the dam through the turbine.
<br> - Spillway: Percent of the release that survived that passed the dam through the spillway.
<br> - Transport: Percent of the release that survived the entire transportation process from the dam to the release site.
<br> - FPE: Fish passage efficiency.
<br> - Premort Transport: Number of fish in the release which were captured for transport.
<br> - Postmort Transport: Number of fish in the release which survived transport to the release point.

<li><strong>Histogram Control</strong>
<br> - Bin Size: set the size of each bin for survival histogram. In the example, the bin size is set to .02 (2%) for the survival histogram. The X-axis range is from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%). Each bar in the histogram represents 2%. With the bin size set to 2%, the games of the alternative are divided into 50 bins. The histogram represents what percent of the games (Y-axis) in the alternative fell within each 2% range. For travel time, the Bin Size entry field has been deactivated; the bin size is set to 1.

<li><strong>Print</strong>: Opens the <a href="83.html">Output Window</a> with the survival or travel time statistics. Use the functions of the Output Window to print the information or save it to a file.

<li><strong>Plot</strong>: Calculates survival or travel time statistics and draws graph in the <strong>Analysis Tool</strong> graph window based on the selections made.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: Opens context-sensitive help window.

<li><strong>Done</strong>: Closes Monte Analysis Tool window.
