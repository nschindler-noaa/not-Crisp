<h4>Preferred Fish Spill Periods</h4>
<p>
Selecting <a href="366.html"><strong>Dam</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="370.html"><strong>Spill Schedule</strong></a> opens the <strong>Preferred Fish Spill Periods</strong> window and its companion window <a href="66.html">Planned Spill Days</a> for adjusting spill operations at dams. The <a href="371.html">Planned Spill</a> section discusses how the settings in these two windows work together. The <strong>Preferred Fish Spill Periods</strong> window controls Fish Spill Days, the Julian days when spill is allocated for fish passage, and Fish Spill Hours, the hours of the day when water will actually be spilled.
</p><p>
This is a <a href="95.html">Schedule Tool</a> window with the following features:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Dam Menu</strong>: Designates the dam to which fish spill days and hours apply.

<li><strong>Preferred Days</strong> list: Designates the actual days on which spill occurs.

<li><strong>Preferred Hours </strong>list: Designates the hours of spill for a period of fish spill days highlighted in the Preferred Days list.
</ul>
<p>
In the figure below, fish spill is identified for days 0 to 365 and fish spill hours 0 to 24 (fish spill operates all day, all year-round). Use the <strong>Start Day</strong>, <strong>Stop Day</strong>, <strong>Start Hour</strong>, and <strong>Stop Hour</strong> text boxes to create new periods or modify existing preferred fish spill periods. In order to set periods where fish spill is not occurring, you must clear the <strong>Preferred</strong> check box and set the values for <strong>Start Day</strong>, <strong>Stop Day</strong>, <strong>Start Hour</strong>, and <strong>Stop Hour</strong> during which fish spill is not to occur. For example, if you want fish spill to only occur at night and not during the day hours (6-18):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the <strong>Preferred</strong> check box.
<li>Type the desired <strong>Start Day</strong> and <strong>Stop Day</strong> for the period fish spill is not to occur.
<li>Type 6 for <strong>Start Hour</strong> and 18 for <strong>Stop Hour</strong>.

<li>Click <img src="larrow.jpg"> to transfer the values from the text boxes to the <strong>Spill Days</strong> and <strong>Spill Hours </strong>list.
</ol>
<p>
The new/modified values only take effect after clicking <strong>Apply</strong> / <strong>Apply All</strong> / <strong>OK</strong>.
