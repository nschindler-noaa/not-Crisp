Keywords and descriptions for global tokens and parameters
</h4><ul>
<li><strong>gas_dissp_exp</strong>: An exponent controlling degassing of total dissolved gas from the water (*10^-4cm^2/sec). This depends on river velocity and depth.

<li><strong>hw_flow_prop</strong>: Specifies overall water availability in the system relative to an average water year for <a href="373.html">Scenario Mode</a> runs. This is a portion of mean flow as the fraction of an average water year. Set in the <a href="47.html">Headwater Modulation</a> window.

<li><strong>ufree</strong>: River velocity in free flowing portions of river (in kfs*10^-1).

<li><strong>fork_threshold</strong>: Defines how big a river fork must be before elevation changes propagate up it. See <a href="46.html">River Parameters</a> for further details on how this is used in COMPASS operations.

<li><strong>water_travel_upper_segment</strong>: Used in transport mortality calculations. Set by COMPASS to be Little Goose Pool. There is no GUI to set this parameter.

<li><strong>water_travel_lower_segment</strong>: Used in transport mortality calculations. Set by COMPASS to be Estuary. There is no GUI to set this parameter.

<li><strong>water_travel_first_day</strong>: Used in transport mortality calculations. Set by COMPASS to be 1. There is no GUI to set this parameter.

<li><strong>water_travel_last_day</strong>: Used in transport mortality calculations. Set by COMPASS to be 365. There is no GUI to set this parameter.

<li><strong>runtime_settings</strong>: Specifies what functional relationships to consider during both Scenario and Monte Carlo runs. The single value is a combination of up to 3 flags, each of which is a single binary digit, arithmetically added together.
<br> - 1 = <a href="386.html">variance suppression</a> turned on
<br> - 2 = <a href="387.html">predator density / volume interaction</a> turned on
<br> - 4 = <a href="388.html">age dependent fge</a> turned on

<li><strong>mortality_class</strong>: Indicates which <a href="389.html">Mortality Model</a> is being used during Scenario and Monte Carlo runs: Gas &amp; Pred Mortality (gas_pred) or Simple Mortality (simple). The currently calibrated Mortality Model is <b>Gas &amp; Pred Mortality</b>.
