<h3>TDG Saturation &gt; 100%: Reach</h3>
<p>
Selecting a Reach from <a href="362.html"><strong>Reservoir</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">TDG Saturation &gt; 100%<img src="subm.jpg">Reach </strong>opens a histogram of the level of total dissolved gas (tdg) exiting the reach for viewing only. Tdg saturation for both the left-bank flow (red) and right-bank flow (blue) levels are marked on the same graph. These flows often have different levels of gas upon exiting a dam because of the gas production from spill. As the water flows downstream, the level of total dissolved gas decreases due to dissipation across the air-water surface. For reaches directly above a dam, this corresponds to the forebay dissolved gas level. Histograms of the daily tdg level are displayed in percent above 100, the equilibrium level. For example, if saturations vary between 100% and 110%, the Y-axis will range from 0 to 10 with the Julian date on the X-axis.
