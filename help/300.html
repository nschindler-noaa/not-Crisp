<p>
COMPASS models passage and survival of multiple salmon substocks through the Snake and Columbia rivers and their tributaries and the Columbia River Estuary.

The model recognizes and accounts for the following aspects of the life-cycles of migratory fish and their interaction with the river system in which they live.
</p><p>
Fish survival through reservoirs depends on:
</p><ul>
<li>predator density and activity 

<li>total dissolved gas supersaturation levels dependent on spill

<li>travel time through a reservoir.
</ul>
<p>
Fish migration rate depends on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>fish behavior and age

<li>water velocity which depends on flow, cross-sectional area of a reach, and reservoir elevation.
</ul>
<p>
Fish passage through dams depends on: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>water spilled over the lip of the dam

<li>turbine operations

<li>bypass screens at turbine entrances and fish guidance sluiceways

<li>fish diel behavior.
</ul>
