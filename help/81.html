<h3>Analysis Tool</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="390.html"><strong>Analysis</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Monte Analysis</strong> opens the <strong>Analysis Tool</strong> graph window and its companion window the <a href="81.html">Monte Analysis Tool</a> for visually examining the results of a Monte Carlo run. The <strong>Analysis Tool</strong> graph window has the same features as a <a href="340.html">Julian Day Output</a> window; however, Julian days are not the unit of measurement for the X-axis. Survival or travel time between the point of release and points downstream can be viewed as either a histogram or cumulative distribution based on the selections made in the <strong>Monte Analysis Tool</strong> window.
</p><p>
By selecting <strong>Survival</strong> or <strong>Travel Time</strong> for Data Type and clicking <strong>Plot</strong> in the <strong>Monte Analysis Tool</strong>, a frequency histogram or cumulative probability distribution of survival or travel time between release and river segment can be opened for passage points of any release.

<b>Survival Graph</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Y-axis</strong>: Percent of games falling within the range of each bin.
<li><strong>X-axis</strong>: Percent survival for the release through the segment for the selected alternative.
<li><strong>Bin Size</strong> set in the <strong>Monte Analysis Tool</strong> determines the size of each bin. In the example graph, each bin is 2% and
<br>20.34% of the games fall within the survival range of 0-1%
<br>11.86% of the games fall within the survival range of 1-3%
<br>13.56% of the games fall within the survival range of 3-5%
<br>11.86% of the games fall within the survival range of 5-7%
<br>6.78% of the games fall within the survival range of 7-9%
<br>5.08% of the games fall within the survival range of 9-11%
<br>11.86% of the games fall within the survival range of 11-13%
<br>13.56% of the games fall within the survival range of 13-15%
<br>5.08% of the games fall within the survival range of 15-17%.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Travel Time Graph</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Y-axis</strong>: Percent of games falling within the range of each bin (1 day).
<li><strong>X-axis</strong>: Travel time in days for the release from the release site through the river segment for the selected alternative.
</ul>
