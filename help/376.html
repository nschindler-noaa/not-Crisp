<h4>Scenario Mode Results (summary.dat)</h4>
<p>
Results produced by executing COMPASS in <a href="373.html">Scenario Mode</a> are written to the <code>summary.dat</code> file and the <a href="84.html">Message Log</a> which includes survival and travel time information for all selected points. Reports of parameter values used during the most recent Scenario Mode run can be generated from the <a href="78.html">Input Data Report</a> window (Analysis menu).
</p><p>
To see the number of fish passing a river segment or dam each day, the cumulative number that eventually pass over the whole season, and percent survival on a species-specific basis open <a href="34.html">Passage Histograms</a> by clicking the desired river segment or dam on the <a href="346.html">River Map</a>.
</p><p>
Information generated from the run is written to the <code>summary.dat</code> file and the Message Log. The output begins with each Release followed by the survival information for each passage point requested (see <a href="374.html">Run Scenario Mode Interactively</a>). Following the release survival information is a summary statement for all releases. Any other data you selected in <a href="63.html">Output Settings</a>, e.g. water temperature, will follow all the release and survival information.
