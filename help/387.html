<h4>predator density / volume interaction</h4>
<p>
The <strong>predator density/volume interaction</strong> option in <a href="76.html">Runtime Settings</a> serves to increase the mortality rate due to predation in COMPASS runs. This runtime setting allows you to specify that predator density should increase as pool volume decreases, that is when the pool is drawn down. This interaction is based on the possibility that concentrating predators in a dam forebay or tailrace increases the encounter rate between predators and prey and thus effectively increases the mortality rate.
</p><p>
If <strong>predator density/volume interaction</strong> is selected (on), predator density is a function of pool elevation for reservoir, forebay and tailrace regions. This setting increases the effective predator density as pools are lowered which in turn increases the predation rate. By default, this option is turned off.
</p><p>
Any <strong>Runtime Settings</strong> you want to take effect during a <a href="75.html">Monte Carlo Mode</a> run must be applied and saved to a yearly input data file (<code>.dat</code> or <code>.cnf</code>) specified in the Monte Carlo alternative.
