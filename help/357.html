<h3>New: Release</h3>

Selecting a release site from <a href="356.html"><strong>Release</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">New</strong> opens the <strong>Release Tool</strong> and its companion graph window, the <a href="40.html">Release Schedule</a>, for creating a release at this site. The list of possible release sites is determined by the specifications in the <a href="319.html">River Description File</a> (<code>columbia.desc</code>). See the <a href="72.html">Release Tool</a> section for further details on creating, editing, and deleting releases.
