<h3>Delay Equation: Delay at Dams</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="366.html"><strong>Dam</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Delay Equation</strong> opens the <strong>Passage Delay</strong> window which displays the passage probability in six hour intervals. The Delay Equation is a COMPASS submodel that delays fish at a dam depending on the species, time of day, season, and flow. The delay is expressed in terms of a passage probability, not in terms of observed passage. The probability of passage depends on the model parameters; in all cases, increasing the parameters decreases the probability of delay and thus time spent in the forebay. The parameters are:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>A day</strong>: Constant term that determines probability of delay during daytime hours.

<li><strong>A night</strong>: Constant term that determines probability of delay during nighttime hours.

<li><strong>B flow</strong>: Coefficient that relates delay probability to river flow.

<li><strong>B Spill</strong>: Coefficient that relates delay probability to percent river spilled.

<li><strong>B date</strong>: Coefficient that relates delay probability to date in the season.
</ul>
<p>
Several factors which affect delay are included in the display. Adjusting these factors does not change model data.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>River vel</strong> (display only): River velocity in the reservoir in miles/day.

<li><strong>Spill fraction</strong> (display only): Percentage of water spilled at the dam.

<li><strong>Julian date</strong> (display only): Julian Day.
</ul>
