<h3>Spill Efficiency: Efficiency of Passing Fish with Spill</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="366.html"><strong>Dam</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Spill Efficiency</strong> opens a window for setting parameters that describe the efficiency of passing fish with spill water at dams. Spill efficiency is set for each dam on a species-specific basis. The spill efficiency equations are of the form, Y = <em>f</em> (X: a, b, c, e), where:
</p><ul>
<li><em>Y</em> = Percent fish passed in spill.

<li><em>X</em> = Percent of river spilled during the spill period.

<li><em>a, b, c </em>= Depend on functional form selected.

<li><em>var</em> = Equation variance parameter set by slider bar (e in equations).
</ul>
<p>
The average efficiency is displayed by a red line in the equation window and the blue lines determine the bound for the variance as set by <em>var</em>. This is an <a href="343.html">Equation Input</a> window.
