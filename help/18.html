<h3>Water Temperature: Dam</h3>
<p>
Selecting a Dam from <a href="362.html"><strong>Reservoir</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Water Temperature<img src="subm.jpg">Dam</strong> opens a histogram of water temperature at the dam for viewing only. Water temperature is set on a daily basis in the headwaters. River temperatures in downstream segments are computed according to the fractions of the incoming flow which are derived from different headwaters in the segment and the temperature of the headwaters on a given day.
