<h4>Keywords and descriptions for dam parameters</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>dam</strong>: Marks the beginning of a dam specification and the name of the dam, e.g. dam Bonneville Dam.

<li><strong>powerhouse_capacity</strong>: Total hydraulic capacity, in kcfs. Same for the second powerhouse (powerhouse_2_capacity).

<li><strong>floor_elevation</strong>: Elevation in feet above sea level of the floor of the forebay above the dam as well as the tailrace downstream from the dam.

<li><strong>forebay_elevation</strong>: Elevation of forebay, in feet above sea level, at full pool.

<li><strong>tailrace_elevation</strong>: Elevation of tailrace, in feet above sea level, at full pool.

<li><strong>bypass_elevation</strong>: The elevation, in feet, of the bypass orifice of a bypass system. When surface is below this level fish bypass is zero. When term is missing the bypass_elevation defaults to the floor_elevation.

<li><strong>spillway_width</strong>: Total width, in feet, of the spillway.

<li><strong>spill_side</strong>: Indicates which side looking downstream from a dam is the spill side. For dams, total dissolved gas saturation in percent above 100 is recorded for both the left-bank flow and right-bank flow levels. These flows often have different levels of gas upon exiting a dam because of the gas production from spill. At each dam the two flows are marked as either the powerhouse flow or the spill flow (spill_side). Consult the table in the <a href="15.html">TDG Saturation &gt; 100%: Dam</a> section to determine whether the spill side<em> </em>is left or right at a specific dam, looking downstream.

<li><strong>pergate</strong>: Amount of flow passed through each spill gate, in kcfs.

<li><strong>ngates</strong>: Number of spill gates at the dam.

<li><strong>gate_width</strong>: Width, in feet, of each spill gate at the dam.

<li><strong>basin_length</strong>: Length, in feet, of the stilling basin.

<li><strong>sgr</strong>: Specific gravity of the roller; this can vary from 0 to 1.

<li><strong>abbrev</strong>: Abbreviation by which this dam will be referred to in flow archives, e.g. BON for Bonneville.

<li><strong>storage_basin</strong>: Defines storage behind headwater dams. Takes two parameters: the minimum and maximum storage capacity, in thousand acre feet (kaf), e.g. <code>storage_basin 0.0 5185.5</code>.

<li><strong>latlon</strong>: Location of the dam in latitude and longitude.

<li><strong>end</strong> (dam name): Marks the end of a dam specification.
</ul>
