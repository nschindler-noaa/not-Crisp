<h3>Powerhouse Capacity</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="366.html"><strong>Dam</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Powerhouse Capacity</strong> opens a window for setting how much flow each dam can put through its powerhouse before being forced to spill the remaining flow. Dams differ in their design, and different dams can accommodate differing amounts of flow through each powerhouse before being forced to spill excess flow.
