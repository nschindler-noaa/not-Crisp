COMPASS is designed to run on a Sun SPARC workstation running Solaris2.X or on a personal computer running Windows 95/NT operating systems. COMPASS should run as expected on Windows 98; however, it has not been tested on the Windows 98 operating system. The first step is to install the model on your computer.
