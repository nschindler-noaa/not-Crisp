<h2>River Map</h2>
<p>
The <strong>River Map</strong> identifies river segments, dams, headwaters, and release sites as determined by the <code>columbia.desc</code> file. The majority of model variables, such as river flow or fish passage, can be accessed from any site on the map by positioning the pointer on the location and clicking a mouse button (<a href="82.html">Mouse Tool</a> settings determine which windows open). The <strong>River Map</strong> contains the following features and functions:
</p><ul>
<li><img src="mfish.jpg"> Potential Release Site

<li><img src="maprel.jpg"> Existing Release Site

<li><img src="mapdam.jpg"> Dam, Potential Transport Site

<li><img src="maptruck.jpg"> Existing Transport Site

<li><strong>To Zoom In</strong>: Drag pointer across the map to select or outline an area and release the mouse button (<strong>1</strong>); the map will be redrawn to show only this area.

<li><strong>To Zoom Out</strong>: Click on an undefined area of the map (<strong>2</strong>).
<br><strong>Alternatives.</strong> Click <img src="unzm.jpg"> in the Toolbar or select <strong>UnZoom</strong> from the View menu.
