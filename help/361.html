<h4>Release Tool Features</h4>
<p>
Parameters for individual releases are set in the <a href="72.html">Release Tool</a> window. Multiple releases can be identified for any site. Setting release parameters uses the <strong>Release Tool</strong> window and the <a href="40.html">Release Schedule</a> graph window.

<b>Release Tool features and functions</b>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Existing Release </strong>(<strong>1</strong>): Indicates whether the release information currently displayed is an existing release or a new release. If the window does not show text on this line, then select a release from the <strong>Existing releases</strong> (<strong>5</strong>) or follow the directions to <a href="359.html">Create New Release</a>.

<li><strong>Release Site</strong> (<strong>2</strong>): Identifies release site. Select release site (includes both existing and possible release sites) from the list.

<li><strong>Species</strong> (<strong>3</strong>): Identifies species of release: Chinook 0, Chinook 1, or Steelhead. Select species from the list.

<li><strong>Stock</strong> (<strong>4</strong>): Identifies stock of release. This can be set to "Generic" or a specific stock can be selected, e.g. Catherine Creek Ch1. Select stock from the list.

<li><strong>Existing releases</strong> (<strong>5</strong>): Identifies the active existing release. You can select another existing release from the list.

<li><strong>Release Start (Julian Day)</strong> (<strong>6</strong>): Specifies the first day of a release. This parameter can be changed by:
<br> - typing in the text box on the right of the slider (<strong>a</strong>), or
<br> - dragging the slider box (<strong>b</strong>), or
<br> - clicking on either side of the slider box (<strong>c</strong>) to adjust the Julian Day value by increments of 10, or

<li><strong>Smoltification Onset (Julian Day)</strong><em> </em>(<strong>7</strong>): Specifies the Julian Day at which fish will begin to migrate.
