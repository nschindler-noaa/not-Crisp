<h1>Parameter Glossary</h1>
<p>
The <strong>Parameter Glossary</strong> includes terms that occur in the COMPASS input files: <code>columbia.desc</code> and <code>base.dat</code>. (See the <a href="392.html">River Description File Structure</a> and <a href="396.html">Yearly Input Data File Structure</a> sections, respectively, for further details.) Category indicates whether the Keyword or Token is part of the Dam, Reach, Headwater, Species or Global specifications in the River Description file or the Yearly Input Data file. Terms that are not in bold designate parameters not recommended for use in model operations or parameters not currently in use.

When reading from a flow archive file, flows are propagated upstream from dams. If a dam has no other dams upstream of it, then its flow will be apportioned amongst all unregulated headwaters above it (after allowing for any contributions of regulated headwaters above it or losses in intervening reaches). The flow to be apportioned amongst unregulated headwaters is divided up according to their flow_max values.

The mixing rate is with respect to time and is set by default to be 0.075 (mile)^-1, which leads to roughly 95% mixing after 40 miles.

<li><strong>gate_width</strong> [Dam]: Width, in feet, of each spill gate at the dam.

<li><strong>headwater</strong> [Headwater]: Names the headwater. This name must be present in the <code>columbia.desc</code> file, and must have a paired "end" statement. e.g. headwater Columbia_Headwater, and end headwater (Columbia_Headwater).
