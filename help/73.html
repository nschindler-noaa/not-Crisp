<h3>Transport: Transport Tool</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="366.html"><strong>Dam</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Transport</strong> opens the <strong>Transport Tool</strong>. By using the <strong>Transport Tool</strong>, you can control transport parameters which include the timing and numbers of fish transported. You can specify transportation of fish from any transport point (dam) to any river segment downstream. On the <a href="346.html">River Map</a>, the <img src="mapdam.jpg"> icon designates the location of possible transport sites and the <img src="maptruck.jpg"> icon designates the location of existing transports as defined in a <a href="320.html">Yearly Input Data File</a> (<code>.dat</code>) or a <code>.dam</code> file.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Note.</strong> Rules of transportation are made to conform to the regulations according to the Fish Passage Plan for 1991. (Corps of Engineers Projects, US Army Corps of Engineers North Pacific Division report CENPD-PE-WM March 1991.)</blockquote>
