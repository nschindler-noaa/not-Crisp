<h1>COMPASS.6 Highlights: Updates, Changes and New Features</h1>
<p>

Version 1.6 of the CRiSP Model includes many updates, changes and new features. <b>Yearly Input Data Files</b> from previous versions of the model can be converted into the new version data files by reading the files into COMPASS.6 and writing the data out to your local system. We recommend using the COMPASS.6 calibrated values. Changes to the model in version 1.6 include improvements to the internal operation of the model and the graphical user interface (GUI). The following list highlights many of the improvements to the model.
<p>
<ul>
<li><u>Total Dissolved Gas</u>. Dissolved gas production algorithms have been completely replaced. New model features include <b>Reach Gas Theta</b>, <b>Dam Gas Theta</b>, <b>K Entrain</b>, and three new TDG Saturation equations (Day, Night, and Backup). The new equations have new parameters and new functional forms.

<li><u>Predation</u>. The predation submodel has been improved. The <b>predator density / volume interaction</b> algorithm has been changed completely. A new parameter, the <b>Predator Distribution Coefficient</b>, controls the new interaction. The <b>Predation Temperature Response Equation</b> was updated.

<li><u>Delay Equation</u>. The Dam <b>Delay Equation</b> algorithm has been completely replaced.

<li><u>FLUSH Model</u>. We have added the capability to calculate mortality based on the FLUSH Model (based only on running time since release). New model features include the <b>Simple Mortality Equation</b> and the <b>FLUSH Transport Merit Equation</b>. FLUSH Model equations and parameter values were based on work completed for the PATH process.

<li><u>Gas Distribution</u>. The Gas Distribution window displays dissolved gas distribution along a given reach. This is the only graph window in CRiSP Passage whose X-axis represents space (river miles) rather than time (days).

<li><u>Reach Regulation Points</u>. COMPASS can now process reach flow data in flow archive files. Reaches can be potential regulation points, and if a reach flow is given in the flow archive, it is propagated upstream to headwaters, and downstream as losses, in the same way that flow archive data for dams is handled.

<li><u>Basin Volumes</u>. It is now possible to graphically edit basin volumes for headwaters with storage basins (Hells Canyon, Dworshak, and Chief Joseph dams, currently). Headwater flow, basin volume, and dam outflow are all editable
and all interact with each other automatically and appropriately.

<li><u>Upstream Propagation</u>. Upstream propagation of elevation changes now runs through forks more realistically. The <b>Fork Threshold</b> parameter defines how big a fork must be before elevation changes propagate up it.

<li><u>Graph Window Features</u>. Graph windows have become more capable: a second toolbar allows the user to select drawing method, switch between automatic and fixed scaling, and to group several graph windows together so that they use the same vertical scale.

<li><u>Keyboard Control</u>. Keyboard control of dialog windows has been implemented.
