<h3>Predation Temperature Response Equation</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="363.html"><strong>Behavior</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Predation Temperature Response Equation</strong> opens a window for setting the temperature response component of predator activity which determines maximum consumption rates as a function of temperature. These functions are based on laboratory experiments. Predation mortality in COMPASS is related to predator abundance, predator temperature response, and a predator activity coefficient (see the <a href="52.html">Predation Coef</a> section for further details). These factors combine to determine a predation rate which is applied to the smolt population on a time-step basis. There are three choices for <strong>Predation Temperature Response Equation</strong>: two exponential forms and a sigmoidal form. In the sigmoidal form (the recommended equation), the variables are as follows:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Cmax</strong>: Represents the maximum consumption rate.

<li><strong>alpha</strong>: Determines the steepness of the sigmoidal.

<li><strong>T_inf</strong>: Sets the inflection point temperature.
</ul>
