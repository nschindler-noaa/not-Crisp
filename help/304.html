<h2>Species and Stocks</h2>
<p>
The species and stocks of fish entering the river system are arbitrarily defined. Species are identified as:
</p><ul>
<li>Yearling chinook, usually the progeny of "spring" run chinook salmon;

<li>Subyearling chinook, usually the progeny of "fall" run chinook salmon on the Snake River;

<li>Subyearling chinook, usually the progeny of "summer" run chinook on the mid-Columbia River; and

<li>Steelhead.
</ul>
<p>
Stocks are identified by their species, spawning stream, and season. The number of fish released at each site is identified on a daily basis. Each release group has a unique set of passage parameters and corresponding model results are tabulated separately.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Note.</strong> Wild and hatchery migrants do not necessarily need to be defined as separate stocks if separate tracking is not desired, but definition as separate stocks is required if you assign them different parameter values (e.g. different vulnerability to predation, swimming behavior, etc.). If you want to keep track of different stocks as different releases with the same parameters, COMPASS tracks each release separately in both Monte Carlo Mode and Scenario Mode.</blockquote>
