<h3>Reach Gas Theta</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="362.html"><strong>Reservoir</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Reach Gas Theta</strong><em> </em>opens a window for setting the mixing parameter for dissolved gas in a specified reach. Gas Theta determines the rate of mixing between the gas levels in the left-bank and right-bank flows of the river (facing downstream). These flows often have different levels of gas upon exiting a dam and become more mixed as the river flows downstream. The mixing rate is with respect to time and is set by default to be 0.075 (mile)^-1, which leads to roughly 95% mixing after 40 miles. A value of zero for <strong>Reach Gas Theta</strong> results in no mixing between the flows and a value of 10 allows for complete mixing between the flows.
