<h3>Monte Alt. Comparison: Comparing Two Distributions</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="390.html"><strong>Analysis</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Monte Alt. Comparison</strong> opens the <strong>Alternative Comparison</strong> window for comparing two alternatives. You can compare two alternatives to determine if the probability distributions are statistically different.
</p><p>
<b>Alternative Comparison features</b>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Alternative 1 and 2</strong>: Select alternatives to be compared.

<li><strong>Year</strong>: Select (power) year for each alternative.

<li><strong>Release</strong>: Select release points for each alternative.

<li><strong>Passage Point</strong>: Select passage point.

<li><strong>Data Type</strong>: Select Survival or Travel Time.

<li><strong>Compute</strong>: Performs the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the selections made.

<li><strong>Done</strong>: Closes the Alternative Comparison window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: Opens context-sensitive help window.
</ul>
<p>
The <strong>Alternative Comparison</strong> window uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> tested is that the two distributions are drawn from the same population, i.e. they are identical. To test this hypothesis, the <strong>d</strong> statistic is used. Results from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are displayed in the lower-left corner of the window.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>d</strong> statistic is the maximum value of the absolute difference between the two cumulative distributions being tested.

<li>The <strong>probability</strong> measure is the fraction of times that a sample drawn from a distribution would be less than <strong>d</strong> if the two distributions were the same.
<br>Probability (<strong>d</strong> &gt; observed by chance if pdf the same)
</ul>
<p>
The closer the probability is to zero the more likely the two distributions are statistically different. As a typical example, we would reject the hypothesis that the two distributions are the same for <strong>probability</strong> &lt; 0.01.
