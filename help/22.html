<h3>Transport Mortality Equation: Relating Transport Mortality to Flow</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="366.html"><strong>Dam</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Transport Mortality Equation</strong> opens a window for specifying a relationship between water particle travel time (WPTT) and transport survival. The relationship is based on the assumption that changes in flow affect how well fish survive transportation. You can set four parameters in the <strong>Transport Mortality Equation</strong> window:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>tt1</strong>: Shorter of two WPTT values.

<li><strong>m1+: </strong>Determines the increase over the base mortality level (set in the <a href="69.html"><strong>Mortality</strong></a> window) for transport that you want to associate with WPTT values of tt1 or shorter.

<li><strong>tt2</strong>: Longer of the two WPTT values.

<li><strong>m2+</strong>: Associates an increase over the base mortality level (set in the <strong>Mortality</strong> window) for transport where WPTT values are tt2 or longer.
</ul>
<p>
Between <strong>tt1</strong> and <strong>tt2</strong>, COMPASS interpolates in a linear fashion. This is an <a href="343.html">Equation Input</a> window.
