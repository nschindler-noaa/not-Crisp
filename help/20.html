<h3>Velocity: River velocity in a reach</h3>
<p>
Selecting a Reach from <a href="362.html"><strong>Reservoir</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Velocity</strong> opens a histogram of the daily river velocity in miles per day for the reach for viewing only. The river velocity through a reach is calculated based on water elevation, bathymetry, and the daily flow level in the segment. Bathymetry data is read in to COMPASS from the <a href="319.html">River Description File</a> (<code>columbia.desc</code>).
