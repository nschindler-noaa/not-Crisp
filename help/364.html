<h2>Flow</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Flow</strong> menu controls input of flows to the river system at headwaters, removal of water for irrigation, and changes in both the reservoir and river segment elevation levels. The computation of flow in any river segment depends on the way COMPASS is run.

In the <a href="373.html">Scenario Mode</a>, flows in all river segments are determined from the flows generated in headwaters and flow inputs and losses in each river segment from irrigation. Outflows from storage reservoirs are specified according to the volume constraints of the reservoirs. Finally, river flows are produced using the <em>downstream propagation</em> algorithm which combines storage reservoir flows and unregulated headwater flows.
</p><p>
In <a href="75.html">Monte Carlo Mode</a>, average flows over defined periods at the dams are read as input from flow archive files produced by hydroregulation models. The period average flows are then <em>modulated</em> to give simulated daily flows at the dams. Using this information, flows in the headwaters are calculated with an <em>upstream propagation</em> algorithm. Finally, flows through river segments are calculated from the headwaters with the <em>downstream propagation</em> algorithm.
