<h4>Set Monte Carlo Output and Runtime Settings</h4>
<p>
When running in Monte Carlo mode, a number of results are calculated by the model, but only those requested by you will be available following the run. Before starting a Monte Carlo simulation, all output data and runtime settings must be specified.
</p><p>
<b>Output Settings</b>
</p><p>
To view and analyze survival and travel time information for any point in the river, the appropriate passage points must be specified before the run. Other output data also must be specified including water temperature and the average flow experienced by fish between the mean release date and mean passage date to any point in the river. There are two ways to save output data from Monte Carlo runs.
</p><p>
You can specify the output settings in each yearly input data file before running Monte Carlo alternatives.
</p><ol>

<li>Select <strong>File<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="348.html"><strong>Open</strong></a> and select a yearly input data file specified in the Monte Carlo alternative.

<li>Select <strong>Run<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="63.html"><strong>Output Settings</strong></a> and set the desired options in the <strong>Output Settings for Dams</strong>, <strong>Output Settings for Reaches</strong> and <strong>Output Settings for Headwaters</strong> windows.

<li>Select <strong>File<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="349.html"><strong>Save As</strong></a> to save the yearly input data file to disk.

<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for each yearly input data file specified in the alternative.
</ol>
<p>
OR
</p><p>
You can <a href="385.html">Lock Output Settings</a> during the run.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Run<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="63.html"><strong>Output Settings</strong></a> and set the desired options in the <strong>Output Settings for Dams</strong>, <strong>Output Settings for Reaches</strong> and <strong>Output Settings for Headwaters</strong> windows.

<li>Select the <strong>Lock current output settings</strong> check box in the Monte Carlo window to override any output settings specified in the yearly input data files for each Monte Carlo simulation. This is the same as selecting <strong>Run<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="385.html"><strong>Lock Output Settings</strong></a>.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Runtime Settings</b>
</p><p>
COMPASS can be run with different functions that effect the movement and survival of fish through the river system. Any specifications for <a href="76.html">Runtime Settings</a> must be selected, applied and saved to the appropriate yearly input data files before running Monte Carlo.
</p><p>
For example, if you forget to turn off <a href="386.html"><strong>variance suppression</strong></a> in a particular yearly input data file, you need to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>File<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="348.html"><strong>Open</strong></a> and select the yearly input data file being used in alternative to read the file into COMPASS.

<li>Select <strong>Run<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="76.html"><strong>Runtime Settings</strong></a>.

<li>Turn off <strong>variance suppression</strong> and click OK.

<li>Select <strong>File<img src="subm.jpg"></strong><a href="349.html"><strong>Save As</strong></a> to save the yearly input data file to disk.
</ol>
<p>
After making all settings for parameters and output for each alternative, you are ready to <a href="382.html">Run Monte Carlo Interactively</a> or <a href="383.html">Run Monte Carlo in Batch Mode</a>.
