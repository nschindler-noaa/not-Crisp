<h3>Monte Carlo: Monte Carlo Mode</h3>
<p>
Selecting <a href="372.html"><strong>Run</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Monte Carlo</strong> opens the <strong>Monte Carlo</strong> window for creating, deleting and editing Monte Carlo alternatives. Monte Carlo Mode runs COMPASS for one or more combinations of water year and system operations. Flows are specified at dams or reaches and propagated upstream to the headwaters. In each run, a different flow regime and other model parameters are used. Fish survival is determined for each run and the distribution of survivals from all runs provides an estimate of the probability distribution of survival under the specified conditions.
</p><p>
The main variable changed in each run is river flow. Flow is generated from runs of the hydroregulation models maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers (HYSSR) and BPA (HYDROSIM). The hydroregulation models use <em>historical water data</em> and a projection of electrical demand to simulate system flows, which are designated a <a href="323.html">Flow Archive File</a>. These files provide period-averaged flows at operating projects which are modulated by COMPASS to represent daily flows. COMPASS uses the modulated flows along with a <a href="320.html">Yearly Input Data File</a> for each power year to describe the system operations and fish biological parameters to produce histograms of survival and travel time. The COMPASS distribution includes the "flow.data" directory which contains weekly averaged flow files for each year from 1961 to 1994.
</p><p>
In Monte Carlo Mode, you can run COMPASS with one or more alternatives. An alternative is a file containing the flow file name, the number of games (runs), the number of years (power years), and the name of the <a href="320.html">Yearly Input Data File</a> to use for each power year in the alternative. The <strong>Monte Carlo</strong> window contains three panels: Alternatives to run, Alternative being edited, and Run control. In the following sections, you will find details on creating, deleting, editing and running Monte Carlo alternatives.
