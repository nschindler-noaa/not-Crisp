<h3>Loss: Flow Loss</h3>
<p>
Selecting a Reach from <a href="364.html"><strong>Flow</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Loss</strong> opens a window for setting flow loss for the selected river segment. Flow loss in each segment is the loss of flow due to withdrawal, mainly from irrigation, on a daily basis or groundwater input on a daily basis. In the <strong>Loss</strong> window, positive values represent withdrawals and negative values represent return flows.
</p><p>
The loss data in a segment represents the change in flow that occurs between the flow input (calculated from the flow of upstream segments) and the flow output (stored as data in the segment). Where not specified, flow loss is set to zero.
