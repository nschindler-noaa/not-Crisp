<h2>COMPASS Parser</h2>
<p>
This is a description of the COMPASS data parser syntax which is used for reading data into COMPASS. The parser reads and interprets parameter data files.
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Vocabulary</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Token</strong>: A character sequence that denotes a command, number, or other data item. Tokens are separated from each other by white space (spaces, tabs, new lines). 
<br> - Example tokens: <code>spill</code>, <code>steelhead</code>, <code>4.6</code>,<code> </code>and <code>Bonneville</code>.

<li><strong>Command</strong>: A token that tells the parser to take an action. For example, the word "spill" tells the parser to treat numeric tokens following it as a dam spill.

<li><strong>Menu</strong>: A set of commands.

<li><strong>Value</strong>: A floating point or integer number.

<li><strong>Index</strong>: An integer that usually indicates an array element.
</ul>
<h4>Parser</h4>
<p>
The parser reads tokens in sequential order from the beginning of a file to the end. If it finds a syntax error, it tries to recover by skipping the data and continuing at the beginning of the next line. The general format of the data is:<code> </code><strong>token_name value(s)</strong><code>.</code>
</p><p>
<b>Example</b>
</p><pre>	dam Dworshak_Dam
pred_density_forebay 376.53
pred_density_tailrace 1000.00
tailrace_length 1000.00
mod_ou_r 0.90
mod_ou_sigma 2.00
mod_norm_sigma 3.00
mod_weekly_amp 0.00
nsat_day_equation  18
parameter 0 3.310000 -10.000000 55.000000 
parameter 1 0.460000 -1.000000 4.000000 
parameter 2 -0.032000 -0.400000 0.100000 
end nsat_day_equation ( )
...
powerhouse_capacity 10.50
powerhouse_schedule 0:365 (0:24)
end dam (Dworshak_Dam)
</pre>
<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>
Comments start with the "#" token. When the parser encounters a #, it discards the rest of the line. You may type anything between the # and the <strong>Return &lt;cr&gt;</strong>.
</p><p>
<b>Example</b>
</p><pre>	# This file contains data for Dworshak Dam
dam Dworshak Dam # Dworshak is on the Snake River
abbrev DWR # storage reservoir for North Fork Clearwater
latlon  46 30 51  N  116 17 40  W
end (Dworshak) # another comment
</pre>
<h4>Include Command</h4>
<p>
COMPASS contains the command <strong>include</strong> which allows you to specify in a data file that you want the model to read data from an additional file when reading data from the top level file. The <strong>include</strong> command is followed by the name of the file that should be read at the same time. The <strong>include</strong> command can appear anywhere in the file below the file header and version number line. A parameter data file can contain several <strong>include</strong> commands. Each <strong>include</strong> command should appear on a separate line and only one file can be specified per each <strong>include</strong> command line. The file <code>sample.dat</code> which contains the line
</p><pre>	include chinook1.rls</pre>
<p>
instructs the model to read the release information contained in <code>chinook1.rls</code> file when the model reads <code>sample.dat</code>. For any parameter data file types, except a <a href="322.html">Control File</a>, once you read the data into COMPASS and save the information on disk, the include line is replaced by the actual data contained in the file. Files which are included are not subject to the same file name extension examination as the top level file (see the <a href="325.html">Reading Data into COMPASS</a> section for more information).
</p>
<h4>Menus</h4>
<p>
Some commands indicate that the tokens that come after it are part of a different set of commands or menu. For example, the <strong>dam</strong> command indicates that commands after it are subcommands. This can be thought of as switching menus or selecting a submenu. These commands must be terminated with an <strong>end</strong> command.
</p>
<h4>The End Command</h4>
<p>
The <strong>end</strong> command indicates that the current submenu is ending and to switch back to the original menu. Everything between an <strong>end</strong> token and its line ending is treated as a comment. The text between the <strong>end</strong> token and the end of the line marks which menu or submenu is ending.

<b>Example</b>
</p><pre>	dam The_Dalles_Dam
powerhouse_capacity 375.00
powerhouse_schedule 0:365 (0:24)
spill_cap 235.00
fish_spill 0:365 (0:24)
end dam (The_Dalles_Dam)

<h3>Array Syntax</h3>
<p>
The simplest array syntax lists values for the parameter in sequential order.
</p><pre>	ArrayName<em> Value Value Value</em> ... </pre>
<p>
<b>Example</b>
</p><pre>
loss 0.00 2.06 0.00 0.00 4.63 4.80 3.73
</pre>
<h4>Limits</h4>
<p>
Arrays start at element 0. The last array index is one less than the number of elements in the array (n-1). For example, the fictional array <strong>sample</strong> has 300 numbers in it. It is defined in C as float sample[300], so its first element is accessed as sample[0] and its last one as sample[299].
</p>
<h4>Index Numbers</h4>
<p>
The parser can be told to start adding values at a particular spot in the array by putting an index number in brackets to indicate the location. Instead of putting the first number after the brackets in element <strong>0</strong>, it puts it in the element <strong>Index</strong>.
</p><pre>	ArrayName [Index] <em>Value Value Value</em> ...</pre>

<p>
In the following example, the first value 45 will be applied to the element 3.
</p><pre>
spill [3] 45 45 45 50</pre>

<p>
Index numbers do not have to be right after the command, and you can have more than one of them. For example, the following will set elements 0 through 2 to be 3, elements 5 through 7 to be 45, and elements 10 through 12 to be 50.
</p><pre>
spill 3 3 3 [5] 45 45 45 [10] 50 50 50
</pre>
<h4>Ranges</h4>
<p>
A range of locations can be set to one number in an array by putting the starting index and ending index of the range separated by a ":" inside brackets. The range is set to be the single number after the brackets.
</p><pre>	ArrayName [BeginIndex : EndIndex] <em>Value
</em></pre>
<p>
In the following example, the first value 45 will be applied to elements 0 through 12.
</p><pre>	spill [0:12] 45
</pre>
<p>
Like index numbers, ranges can appear anywhere in the array specification and you can have as many of them as you want. For example, the following will set elements 0 through 12 to be 45 and elements 13 through 50 to be 120.
</p><pre>	spill [0:12] 45 [13:50] 120
</pre>
<h4>Global Ranges</h4>
<p>
To set one value to an entire array, put a "*" between brackets as an index. The entire array will be set to the single value after the brackets.
</p><pre>	ArrayName [*] <em>Value
</em></pre>
<p>
<b>Example</b>
</p><pre>	spill [*] 10
</pre>
<h4>Combinations</h4>
<p>
You can combine any of the above techniques. For example, if you want to set all the elements of an array named <strong>sample</strong> to be 1 except for the 25th and 252nd elements, which you want to be 155, you could type:
</p><pre>	sample [*] 1 [25] 155 [252] 155
</pre>
<p>
Most of the output routines for data use syntax similar to the following.
</p><pre>	ArrayName [0:20] 3.45 [21:30] 4.2 5.6 4.8345 [33:200] 5.0
</pre>
<p>
The current array index after setting a range of array elements is one after the last element set. For example,
</p><pre>	ArrayName [0:10] 20
</pre>
<p>
sets array elements 0 through 10 to be 20, and the current array index is set to 11. So,
</p><pre>	ArrayName [0:10] 20 99
</pre>
<p>
sets the 11th element of the array to be 99.
</p>
<h4>Conflicts</h4>
<p>
It is possible to specify the same index of an array several times. When this happens, the value stored is the last value set. For example,
</p><pre>	sample 55 48 27 [2] 30 45 [3] 12 14 25 [4:50] 100
</pre>
<p>
sets element 0 to 55, element 1 to 48, element 2 to 30 (value 27 is discarded), element 3 to 12 (value 45 is discarded), and elements 4 through 50 to 100 (values 14 and 25 are discarded). In this example,
</p><pre>	sample 55 46 [*] 1
</pre>
<p>
all elements of sample are set to 1.
</p>
<h4>Summary of Array Syntax</h4>
<pre>	ArrayName <em>Value Value Value...
</em>	ArrayName [ StartIndex ] <em>Value Value Value...
</em>	ArrayName [ StartIndex : EndIndex ] <em>Value
</em>	ArrayName [*] <em>Value
</em></pre>
<h3>Periods</h3>
<p>
Periods (time periods) are usually used for scheduling things such as spill. They can have a value associated with them that usually indicates a degree to which something is on. Periods are analogous to sparse arrays, except that a period can have several sub-periods associated with it.
</p>
<h4>Period Ranges</h4>
<p>
A period range is denoted by the starting number followed by a ":" and then the ending number. For example, 
</p><pre>	0:10
</pre>
<p>
is a period range starting at 0 and ending at 10. If you only want a range of one number, you do not have to specify the ":" and second number.
</p>
<h4>Period Values</h4>
<p>
To associate a value to a period range, use an "=" followed by the desired value. All values are floating point numbers. For example,
</p><pre>	0:10 = 0.45
</pre>
<p>
would associate the value 0.45 to the range 0 through 10.
</p>
<h4>Period Lists</h4>
<p>
A period list is a sequence of one or more ranges separated by commas. For example,
</p><pre>	0:10, 20:35, 50:360
</pre>
<p>
is a period with three ranges. Ranges in a period list can have values. For example,
</p><pre>	0:10 = .45, 20:35 = .5, 50:360 = .25
</pre>
<p>
is a period with three ranges each of which have values associated with them. This can be thought of as a sparse array.
</p>
<h4>Sub-Periods</h4>
<p>
A range can have a sub-period associated with it. A sub-period uses a format identical to a period list. Sub-periods are usually used for fine tuning when something in a period is on or off. For example,
</p><pre>	0:10 (0:8, 12:24), 50:360 (0:12) 
</pre>
<p>
is a period with two ranges which both have sub-periods.
</p><h4>Period Examples</h4>
<pre>	fish_spill 0:365 (0:24)
planned_spill 0:300 = 0.00
fish_spill 3 (0:8)
planned_spill 0:5 = 0.3, 6 = 0.99, 7:10 = 0
fish_spill 0:10 (0:8), 11:20 (0:12), 100:184 (0:6, 18:24)
planned_spill 0:105 =  0.00, 106:122 =  0.09, 123:164 =  0.53, 165:235 =  
0.41, 236:365 =  0.00
</pre>
<h4>Period Format</h4>
<pre>	PeriodName period-list
period-list = period {, period}
period = [range | range = <em>value</em>] { (sub-period) }
sub-period = period-list
range = [<em>Value</em> | <em>Value</em>:<em>Value</em>]
</pre>
<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>
Equations tell COMPASS which type of equation to use on data and what the parameters are for those equations. The COMPASS equation format is:
</p><pre>	EquationName EqNumber
parameter ParameterNumber value min max
...
end EquationName
</pre>
<p>
where
</p><ul>
<li><strong>EquationName</strong>: Token associated with the equation, e.g. <code>fge_equation</code>.

<li><strong>EqNumber</strong>: Number of the equation type.

<li><strong>ParameterNumber</strong>: Parameter number. Parameter 0 is the first parameter, parameter 2 is the third, etc.

<li><strong>value</strong>: Floating point number you want that parameter to be set to.

<li><strong>min</strong>: Minimum value of a parameter. It is not suggested that you change this from the default value.

<li><strong>max</strong>: Maximum value of a parameter. It is not suggested that you change this from the default value.
</ul>
