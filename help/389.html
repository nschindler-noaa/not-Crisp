<h4>Mortality Model</h4>
<p>
The <strong>Mortality Model </strong>option in <a href="76.html">Runtime Settings</a> specifies which of the two mortality models to use during run execution: <strong>Gas and Pred Mortality</strong> or <strong>Simple Mortality</strong>. COMPASS is currently calibrated for the <strong>Gas and Pred Mortality</strong> model.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Gas and Pred Mortality</strong>: Uses a predation model and new gas model to calculate mortality due to predation and gas based on parameter settings from several windows: <a href="49.html">Reach Predator Density</a><a href="49.html"></a>, <a href="90.html">Predator Distribution Coefficient</a>, <a href="89.html">Predation Temperature Response Equation</a>, <a href="26.html">Gas Mortality Equation</a>, and <a href="52.html">Predation Coef</a> for reaches, forebays, and tailraces.

<li><strong>Simple Mortality</strong>: See <a href="87.html">Simple Mortality Equation</a> under the Behavior Menu for details. This option is based on the FLUSH Model.
</ul>
<p>
Any <strong>Runtime Settings</strong> you want to take effect during a <a href="75.html">Monte Carlo Mode</a> run must be applied and saved to a yearly input data file (<code>.dat</code> or <code>.cnf</code>) specified in the Monte Carlo alternative.
