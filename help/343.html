<h2>Equation Input</h2>
<p>
<strong>Equation Input</strong> windows allow you to view and edit equation settings and parameters which are, in effect, submodels of COMPASS. The response of the equation to the parameters over the possible range of the independent variable is illustrated in the equation window as each parameter is changed. Note that for equation inputs, if you alter an equation and wish to use that altered equation in subsequent model runs you must click the <strong>Apply</strong> button to activate it, otherwise the model will revert to the previously-displayed equation and values.

spill				| % river spill			| % fish passage with spill
tdg saturation			| spill in kcfs			| % tdg sat above 100%
gas mortality			| % tdg sat above 100%		| % mortality/day
population density vs. depth	| depth (ft)			| density, % of population/ft
fge				| fish age			| fish depth parameters
transportation mortality	| water particle travel time	| % transportation mortality
