<h3>Dams: Flow at Dams</h3>
<p>
Selecting a Dam from <a href="364.html"><strong>Flow</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Dams</strong> opens a flow histogram at the dam for viewing only. Flows at dams are determined by input flows specified at the headwater and losses over intervening reaches. You can edit headwater <a href="42.html">Flows</a> or reservoir <a href="33.html">Flow Loss</a>, but not the flow at the dam. In addition, flow output windows can be opened by configuring the <a href="82.html">Mouse Tool</a> and selecting a dam on the <a href="346.html">River Map</a>.
