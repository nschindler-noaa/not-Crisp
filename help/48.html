<h4>Unregulated Max</h4>
<p>
Selecting <a href="364.html"><strong>Flow</strong></a><strong><img src="subm.jpg">Headwater<img src="subm.jpg">Unregulated Max</strong> opens a window for allocating flows to unregulated headwaters, that is streams with a confluence downstream of a dam. This is a 100-year flow used to determine how flow is distributed among unregulated headwaters in the <a href="75.html">Monte Carlo Mode</a>, when flows at the dams are specified. It is not used as a limit and will be automatically reset to the maximum flow placed, if greater than the initial value assigned. Default values are determined by relative cross-sectional areas of the streams.
