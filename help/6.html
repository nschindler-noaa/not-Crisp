<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The Columbia River Salmon Passage model (COMPASS) tracks the downstream migration and survival of migratory fish through the tributaries and dams of the Columbia and Snake Rivers to the estuary. COMPASS describes in detail the movement and survival of individual stocks of natural and hatchery-spawned juvenile salmonids and steelhead through hundreds of miles of river and the major dams. Constructed from basic principles of fish ecology and river operation, COMPASS provides a synthesis of current knowledge on how the major hydroelectric system in the country interacts with one of its major fisheries. Biologists, managers and others interested in the river system can use this interactive tool to evaluate the effects of river operations on smolt survival.
</p><p>
There are five major uses of the model:
</p><ol>

<li><em>educate</em> users on the state of knowledge of the system

<li>develop<em> experiments</em>

<li>evaluate <em>sensitivity</em> of fish survival to different system factors

<li><em>predict</em> survival and travel time for use in life-cycle models and inseason management

<li>estimate <em>uncertainty</em> in predictions.
</ol>
<p>
There are two modes in which COMPASS can be executed. Scenario Mode illustrates the interactions of model variables. Monte Carlo Mode, which is stochastic, provides measures of variability and uncertainty in predicting passage survival. Using Monte Carlo Mode, estimates of probability distributions for survival and travel time can be determined for any stock between any two points in the river system.
</p><p>
COMPASS has advanced programming features including:
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>graphical user interface</em> to access and change model variables and equations

<li><em>flexible data structure</em> that allows expansion of the model while assuring backwards compatibility with earlier versions

<li><em>reconfigurability</em> to a different river without reprogramming

<li><em>online help </em>system.
</ul>
<p>
The model is designed to run on Windows 95/NT operating systems or Sun SPARC workstations running Solaris2.X operating system. COMPASS has been tested in both environments.
</p><p>
COMPASS was developed at Columbia Basin Research, School of Fisheries, University of Washington, under a contract from Environment, Fish and Wildlife, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).
</p><p>
The model is being applied to the Columbia River. As a result, the files describing the river and release points of fish into the river are an essential part of the model. A list of references pertaining to model theory and calibration can be found in the <strong>Theory, Calibration and Validation Manual</strong> (updated version due in 2000).
