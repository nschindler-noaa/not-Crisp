<h4>age dependent fge</h4>
<p>
The <strong>age dependent fge</strong> option in <a href="76.html">Runtime Settings</a> specifies one of two possible functional relationships for fish guidance efficiency (fge): <strong>constant fge</strong> or <strong>time varying fge</strong>. When <strong>age dependent fge</strong> is turned off, the model will use the constant fge condition and the values set in the <a href="71.html">FGE</a> window. Day and night fge then vary randomly on each dam time interval according to fixed probability distributions (the distribution has no seasonal trend). Fge is specific to a given dam and species and its random variations occur for each dam time interval (6 hours).
</p><p>
When <strong>age dependent fge</strong> is turned on, the model run varies fge at dams according to the settings in the <a href="25.html">FGE Equation</a> window and the mean, low and high fge values set in the <a href="71.html">FGE</a> window. When the model is run under this condition, day and night fge change randomly at each dam time interval according to probability distributions that change with fish age and reservoir elevation. Variations in fge from the initial condition depends on the day since the onset of smoltification which is set in the <a href="72.html">Release Tool</a> window, and reservoir elevation for each day which is set with the <a href="32.html">Elevation</a> window.
</p><p>
Any <strong>Runtime Settings</strong> you want to take effect during a <a href="75.html">Monte Carlo Mode</a> run must be applied and saved to a yearly input data file (<code>.dat</code> or <code>.cnf</code>) specified in the Monte Carlo alternative.
