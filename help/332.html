<h4>Edit Single Slider Value</h4>
<p>
There are three ways to edit the value of an individual slider.
</p><ul>
<li>Move the pointer to the slider (<strong>1</strong>) and drag the slider to adjust the value.
<br>OR

<li>Click on either side of the current value of a slider to "jump" the slider value to the point clicked.
<br>OR

<li>Right-click on desired slider to open the <strong>Slider Value</strong> dialog box (<strong>2</strong>), type a value in the text box, and click <strong>OK</strong> to update the display in the Slider Input window. The values displayed above the text box in the Slider Value dialog are the minimum and maximum values allowed for that particular parameter.
</ul>
<p>
All changes made to slider values need to be applied by clicking <strong>Apply</strong> / <strong>Apply All</strong> / <strong>OK</strong> before the values will take effect.

Some <strong>Slider Input</strong> windows contain a tab list (variable list is longer than ten items), click on a letter tab to access a portion of the list and edit the desired slider as directed above. Some <strong>Slider Input</strong> windows contain Mean, Low, and High value sliders which are separate entities and are edited separately.
</p><p>
There are several Slider Input windows which involve setting time-specific, dam-specific and species-specific values for each slider, and there is one Slider Input window which involves setting reach-specific and species-specific values.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="74.html">Predation Probability</a> (time, dam, and species)

<li><a href="69.html">Mortality</a> (dam and species)

<li><a href="71.html">FGE</a> (dam and species)

<li><a href="49.html">Reach Predator Density</a> (reach and species)
</ul>
<p>
Parameter values can be set individually for each species at each dam by selecting the desired species from the species menu, selecting the desired dam from the dam menu, and then following the directions above. If you make multiple changes to dam and species parameter settings, click <strong>Apply All</strong> to save all the changes made. Parameters can be grouped across Time (<strong>T</strong>), Dam (<strong>D</strong>) or Reach (<strong>R</strong>), and Species (<strong>S</strong>) by selecting the appropriate check boxes to the right of the slider. See the <a href="333.html">Edit Multiple Slider Values Simultaneously</a> and <a href="334.html">Edit All Slider Values Simultaneously</a> sections for directions.
