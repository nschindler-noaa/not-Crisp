<h2>Output Files and Directories</h2>
<p>
A COMPASS run generates and stores various information in output files and directories. Without making any selections with <a href="63.html">Output Settings</a> (Run Menu), a model run in either mode generates travel time and survival information at the Estuary. All other data output must be specified prior to the run in <a href="63.html">Output Settings</a> or specified in the data files used during the run. The following files and directories result from model runs and are stored in the COMPASS home directory.
</p><ul>
<li><code>summary.dat</code>: An output file that contains results from the most recent run of COMPASS in the <a href="373.html">Scenario Mode</a>. This includes for each selected passage point:
<br> - number released
<br> - number passing specified points in river system
<br> - number transported
<br> - number censored, i.e. fish remaining in river after tracking time has elapsed (end of the year)
<br> - statistics to lowest point in system including: percent survival; first and last passage days; average number passing; mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of passage days between points.
<br><strong>Note. </strong>A copy of this file can be written to the <a href="84.html">Message Log</a> window by selecting Message from the Logging menu.

<li><code>summary.alt#</code>: An output file that contains results from the most recent run of an alternative in <a href="75.html">Monte Carlo Mode</a> if the "Write supplemental data" check box is selected in the Monte Carlo window or if the <code>-u</code> command line option is used in batch mode. Run results written to this file are determined by the <a href="63.html">Output Settings</a> specified in the yearly input data files used in each alternative.

<li><code>altern#</code>: A Monte Carlo Alternative directory that contains three output files. The files should only be modified by using the <a href="75.html">Monte Carlo</a> tools to make any changes. The files are as follows:
<br> - <code>altern#.alt</code>: name of flow archive, names of input files in an alternative, number of games and years in the archive file, and number of times each archive flow file year is used
<br> - <code>altern#.ind</code>: internal index file generated by COMPASS
<br> - <code>altern#.out</code>: output information used in <a href="80.html">Monte Analysis</a>.
</ul>
